Dictionary-based sentiment analysis system for movie reviews

With many movies releasing each year, it is hard to decide what is worth our time. 
Our project aims to apply sentiment analysis to movie reviews, helping users to quickly understand 
whether a film is well-received or not, which is applicable to filmmakers as it allows them to gain 
market insights as well. By processing the datasets we get, we are able to classify and extract the 
reviews into different sentiments like positive, neutral or negative which eliminates the need for manual 
analysis. The result interface also provides users a gauge if the movie is worth watching with the statistics 
and visualization. It gives a more detailed evaluation of movie reviews using the sliding window feature. 
Our project aims to bring together the voices of moviegoers by analyzing reviews and detecting the emotions 
behind them.
